<h2>Troubleshooting </h2>

1. Use `Settings > Test Notification` to test if notifications are working on your device and are not disabled for this app.

2. Disable Android Battery Optimization :

Butler runs in background so you don't have constantly check order screen. 
Android tries to optimize background jobs to save tiny amount of battery.However you can disable it in settings so butler can do its job better.


3. If disbaling battery Optimization, doesn't work for you, Android version on your phone is still trying to save battery and blocking butler. 
Keep your phone charged and keep it plugged to charger when not in use. 

4. As a last resort, Take refund if you're not able to catch up to order fills.
