  <li> Within App, Use `Settings > Test Notification` to test if notifications are working on your device and are not disabled for this app.
</li>
<li> Disable Android Battery Optimization :
 <br />
Butler runs a very light workload in background to constantly check order status. 
Android OS tries to optimize background jobs to save tiny amount of battery. However, you can disable it in Settings so butler can do its job better.
 
  <br />
  Please use this link to find your phone vendor and respective way to disable Android Battery Optimization.

 <li>If disbaling battery Optimization, doesn't work for you, Its possible Android version on your phone is still trying to save battery and blocking butler. 
Keep your phone charged and keep it plugged to charger when not in use.
